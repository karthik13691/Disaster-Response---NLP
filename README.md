# Disaster-Response---NLP
Pipelines - ETL, NLP and ML pipelines
### Language:
Python

### Platform: 
Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:
* Pandas
* re
* nltk
* sklearn
* sqlalchemy
* pickle

### Project motivation

The aim of this project is to build a ML-NLP model that classifies disaster messages into certain given categories.
I've analyzed disaster data from Figure Eight to build model off Random Forest Classifier to classifies disaster messages.
With the help of a web app, a user can get their input messages classified into several categories.
